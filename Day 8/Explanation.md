Here is a step-by-step explanation of the provided Java code:

### Import Statements
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.security.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.function.*;
import java.util.regex.*;
import java.util.stream.*;
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.joining;
import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;
```
- These are import statements bringing in various Java libraries and classes.
- The static imports `joining` and `toList` from `Collectors` are used for convenience when working with streams.

### Class Definition
```java
public class Solution {
```
- This defines a public class named `Solution`.

### Main Method
```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
```
- This is the main method which serves as the entry point of the program.
- It throws `IOException` to handle input/output errors.

### BufferedReader Initialization
```java
        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
```
- A `BufferedReader` object named `bufferedReader` is created to read input from the standard input stream (usually the keyboard).

### Reading an Integer from Input
```java
        int n = Integer.parseInt(bufferedReader.readLine().trim());
```
- The program reads a line of input, trims any leading and trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer `n`.

### Reading and Parsing the Array
```java
        List<Integer> arr = Stream.of(bufferedReader.readLine().replaceAll("\\s+$", "").split(" "))
            .map(Integer::parseInt)
            .collect(toList());
```
- This line reads another line of input, which is expected to be a series of integers separated by spaces.
- `replaceAll("\\s+$", "")` removes any trailing whitespace from the input line.
- `split(" ")` splits the string into an array of substrings based on spaces.
- `Stream.of(...)` creates a stream from the array of substrings.
- `.map(Integer::parseInt)` converts each substring into an `Integer`.
- `.collect(toList())` collects the results into a `List<Integer>` named `arr`.

### Reversing the List
```java
        Collections.reverse(arr);
```
- This line uses `Collections.reverse()` to reverse the order of elements in the list `arr`.

### Printing the Reversed List
```java
        for (int i : arr) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
```
- This loop iterates over each element `i` in the reversed list `arr` and prints it followed by a space.

### Closing the BufferedReader
```java
        bufferedReader.close();
    }
}
```
- This closes the `BufferedReader` to release system resources associated with it.

### Summary
- The program reads an integer `n` (though `n` is not used further in the code).
- It reads a line of space-separated integers, parses them into a list, reverses the list, and prints the reversed list.
