Certainly! Let's walk through this Java code step by step to understand how it works.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Import Statements

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
```
- **`import java.io.*;`**: Imports classes from the `java.io` package, which includes classes for input and output through data streams, serialization, and the file system.
- **`import java.util.*;`**: Imports classes from the `java.util` package, which includes utility classes such as collections framework, date and time facilities, and scanner class for reading input.

#### 2. Main Class Declaration

```java
public class Solution {
```
- Declares a public class named `Solution`.

#### 3. Main Method Declaration

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
```
- Declares the `main` method, the entry point for the program. It's `public` so it's accessible to the JVM, `static` so it can be run without creating an instance of the class, and returns no value (`void`).

#### 4. Creating a Scanner Object

```java
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
- Creates a `Scanner` object named `scanner` to read input from the standard input stream (`System.in`).

#### 5. Reading the Number of Test Cases

```java
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the newline after the integer input
```
- Reads an integer `n` which represents the number of strings to process.
- `scanner.nextLine();` is used to consume the newline character left after reading the integer. This prevents it from being read as the start of the next input line.

#### 6. Looping Through Each String

```java
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
```
- Starts a loop that will iterate `n` times, processing one string in each iteration.

#### 7. Reading Each String

```java
            String S = scanner.nextLine();
```
- Reads a line of input and stores it in the variable `S`.

#### 8. Initializing StringBuilder Objects

```java
            StringBuilder evenIndexChars = new StringBuilder();
            StringBuilder oddIndexChars = new StringBuilder();
```
- Initializes two `StringBuilder` objects: `evenIndexChars` to store characters at even indices and `oddIndexChars` to store characters at odd indices.

#### 9. Looping Through Each Character in the String

```java
            for(int j = 0; j < S.length(); j++) {
                if(j % 2 == 0) {
                    evenIndexChars.append(S.charAt(j));
                } else {
                    oddIndexChars.append(S.charAt(j));
                }
            }
```
- A nested loop that iterates through each character of the string `S` by its index `j`.
- `if (j % 2 == 0)`: Checks if the index `j` is even. If true, appends the character at index `j` to `evenIndexChars`.
- `else`: If the index `j` is odd, appends the character at index `j` to `oddIndexChars`.

#### 10. Printing the Results

```java
            System.out.println(evenIndexChars.toString() + " " + oddIndexChars.toString());
```
- Prints the characters at even indices followed by a space and then the characters at odd indices for the current string.

#### 11. Closing the Scanner

```java
        scanner.close();
```
- Closes the `Scanner` object to release the resources associated with it.

### Summary
- The program reads an integer `n`, which tells how many strings will follow.
- For each string, it separates characters at even indices and odd indices into two separate `StringBuilder` objects.
- It then prints the even-indexed characters, followed by a space, and then the odd-indexed characters.
- Finally, it closes the scanner.
